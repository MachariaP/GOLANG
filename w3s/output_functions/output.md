### GO Output Functions

- Go has three functions to output text:
        ```* Print()```
        ```*Println()```
        ```*Printf()```

    ## The Print() function
    - Print arguments with its default format.
    - We need to use `\n` to print arguments in a new line.
    -To put space between string arguments, we need to use " ".

    ## The Println() function
    - It is similar to print() except that a whitespace is added between the arguments and a newline is added at the end of the string.

    ## The Printf() function
    - Formats its argument based on the given formating verb.
    - Example of formatting verbs:
        * ```%V``` prints value of the argument
        * ```%T``` prints type of the argument
