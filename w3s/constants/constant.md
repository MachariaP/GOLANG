# GO Constants

- Fixed value that cannot be changed.

- We use **const** keyword.

  

```Syntax

const CONSTNAME type = value

```

  

## Declaring a constant

```const PI = 3.14```

  

- Constant names are written in uppercase letters

- Constants can be declared both inside and outside of a function.

- Constants once declared, it is not possible to change the value later.

  

# Constant Types

- There are of two types:

1. Typed constant

- Declared with a defined type:

```const A int = 1```

  

2. Untyped constant

- Constants declared without a type:

```const A = 1```

  

## Multiple Constants Declaration

- Multiple Constants can be grouped together into a block for readability:

```const (

A int = 1

B = 3.14

C = "Hi!"

)```
