# Go Learning Roadmap

Welcome to my Go learning journey! This roadmap outlines the essential topics I’ll need to master to become proficient in Go, from fundamental syntax to advanced concepts and real-world applications.

## Getting Started with Go

1.  **Setup and Installation**
    
    -   Install Go on your system.
    -   Set up Go workspace and environment variables (`GOPATH`, `GOROOT`, etc.).
    -   Write and run a "Hello, World!" program to test the installation.
2.  **Basic Syntax and Language Fundamentals**
    
    -   Packages and imports
    -   Variables, constants, and types
    -   Basic data types (int, float, string, bool)
    -   Operators and expressions
3.  **Control Structures**
    
    -   Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
    -   Loops (`for`, range-based `for`)
    -   Error handling basics (`error` type, error checks)

## Core Go Programming Concepts

1.  **Functions**
    
    -   Function syntax and return types
    -   Multiple return values
    -   Named return values
    -   Variadic functions
    -   Anonymous functions and closures
2.  **Data Structures**
    
    -   Arrays and slices
    -   Maps (hash maps/dictionaries)
    -   Structs (defining custom types)
    -   Pointers and memory management
3.  **Methods and Interfaces**
    
    -   Defining methods on structs
    -   Interface basics
    -   Type assertions and type switches
    -   Practical use of interfaces for polymorphism
4.  **Error Handling**
    
    -   Error values and custom error types
    -   Handling and returning errors in functions
    -   `panic` and `recover` for managing unexpected errors

## Intermediate Topics

1.  **Concurrency in Go**
    
    -   Goroutines and channels
    -   Buffered and unbuffered channels
    -   Synchronization with `sync` package (e.g., WaitGroups, Mutexes)
    -   Best practices for managing concurrent code
2.  **File I/O and Networking**
    
    -   Working with files (`os` package)
    -   Reading from and writing to files
    -   Basic networking with `net` package (TCP, HTTP)
    -   Building a simple HTTP server
3.  **Testing in Go**
    
    -   Writing unit tests with Go’s testing package
    -   Table-driven tests
    -   Benchmarking and profiling code performance

## Advanced Topics

1.  **Advanced Concurrency Patterns**
    
    -   Context package for managing goroutines
    -   Worker pools and rate limiting
    -   Pipeline patterns and select statements
2.  **Building CLI Tools**
    
    -   Working with command-line arguments (`flag` package)
    -   Creating a basic CLI application
3.  **Modules and Dependency Management**
    
    -   Introduction to Go Modules (`go mod`)
    -   Dependency versioning and updating dependencies
4.  **Reflection and Generics**
    
    -   Reflection (`reflect` package)
    -   Type-safe generics in Go

## Practical Projects and Applications

1.  **Developing Web Applications**
    
    -   Building web servers and RESTful APIs with `net/http`
    -   Using frameworks (e.g., Gin, Echo) for routing and middleware
    -   Implementing JSON serialization and deserialization
2.  **Database Integration**
    
    -   Connecting to databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
    -   Using `database/sql` and ORMs like GORM
    -   Basic CRUD operations and transaction management
3.  **Containerization and Deployment**
    
    -   Dockerizing Go applications
    -   Basic cloud deployment (e.g., deploying to AWS or GCP)
    -   Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for Go apps
4.  **Performance Optimization**
    
    -   Profiling CPU and memory usage
    -   Optimizing code performance and memory usage
    -   Benchmarking critical code sections
