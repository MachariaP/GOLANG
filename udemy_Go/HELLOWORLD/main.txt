** What does ```package main``` mean?
- A ```package``` is a way to organize and structure your code .
- It is a collection of Go files that are grouped together and share the same namespace.

**Breakdown of the concept**
1. Organisation: 
	- Encourages the use of packages to organize code in a modular and reusable way.
	- A package can consist of multiple .go files located in the same directory.

2. IMporting:
	- To use the functionality of a package in your code, you import it using import statement.
	- You can import standard library packages like (fmt, net/http) or your own packages.

3. Package Declaration: 
	- Each Go file starts with a package declaration.
	- The first line of a Go file could be ```package main```, indicating that the file is part of the main package.

4. Standard Library and Third-Party Packages:
	- Go comes with a rich standard library that contains a variety of build-in packages.
	- You can import external packages from third-party repositories using tools like ```go get```.
