### GO TUTORIAL

# Go Syntax
A Go file consists of:
- Package declaration
- Import packages
- Functions
- Statements and expressions

# Go Statements
`fmt.Println("Hello World!")` is a statement.
Statements are separated by ending a line (hitting the Enter key)
or by a semicolon `;`.

# Go Compact Code
It is not recommended because it makes the code more difficult to read.
Example:
`package main; import ("fmt"); func main() {fmt.Println("Hello World!");}`
